    <p> Today I am starting a new project and learning to code!
      <br>It can be complicated at times but I am trying to enjoy it.</br></p>
      Here are some goals:
      <ul>
        <li> Get caught up </li>
        <li> Help the center with programming </li>
        <li> Refresh my skills on a daily basis </li>
      </ul>

      <p>This is one of my favorite websites: <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">Google</a></p>
